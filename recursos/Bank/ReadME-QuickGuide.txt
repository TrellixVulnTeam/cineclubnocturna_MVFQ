HOW TO QUICK USE GUIDE:

Below is a quick outline of how to get the most out of the BANK Typeface. 

Firstly, as a display font, BANK is specifically designed to have more impact at larger sizes, although it is legible in smaller point sizes, go big to allow the layered nature of the type to show through.

No matter what software you use, InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop etc the technique for applying a colour offset look (like the main feature image) is the same:

1. Using Bank Lined, type the text content you need. At this stage add any tracking or kerning adjustments you feel are required to achieve the look you want.
2. Duplicate this type layer (or copy and paste in place) and change the font to Bank Sectioned.
3. Pick/select a colour and set the layer blending mode to 'Multiply' (or adjust the opacity settings if you wish, Mutiply works well though).
4. Duplicate this Bank Sectioned type layer and move it below the other two in the layer stack.
5. Pick/select a new colour for this layer (again I suggest having the layer blending mode set to 'Multiply' but feel free to experiment).
6. Using the selection tool (black arrow), and the arrow keys on your keyboard, nudge this bottom layer to the left and down to achieve an offset/drop-shadow appearance). Obviously you can move this layer to the right, or up, or wherever...and move it using your mouse or stylus/pen; but the above steps outline how the font was specifically intended to be used..but you're free to experiment and play around!
